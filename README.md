# UnityJeopardy
A Unity-based implementation of a Jeopardy-like quiz game

This is a quick implementation of a Unity-based Jeopardy-like game.  All resources are CC-licensed or otherwise open source.  Designed to work with a sqlite back end.

Pardon the minimum of documentation and support.  The project will need to be converted to the latest version of Unity.

Development has been done on a Linux system, so there may be incompatibilities when viewing the project under a Windows-based Unity Editor.
